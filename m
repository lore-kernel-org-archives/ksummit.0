I was wondering whether we should really stop providing .dts files for
*boards* in the *kernel* tree. In my impression this was more a stop-gap
measure to bridge the transition from board files to DT.

Given that the particular board files are rather boring anyway, wouldn't
it be sufficient to just include the SoC .dtsi plus one (or two) example
.dts, for instance for the official evaluation board?
This could be used as a template for creating specific board DTs.
Ideally vendors could put those on their boards: into some flash or
integrated into the firmware (as part of U-Boot, for instance).

And having a source for the .dtsi should make it easier to get a
readable de-compilation of a given .dtb.

We could collect .dts files for boards somewhere else. It's already the
case that we have some boards with a specific SoC "supported by the
kernel" and some not, for no technical reason at all, actually. It's
just whether there is someone willing to post (and push through) a .dts
file.

Cheers,
Andre.
