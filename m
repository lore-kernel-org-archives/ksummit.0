That is 2 separate topics really. For the latter, you need to come up
with reasons to justify the churn.

Are we approaching the limits of # of files in one directory? Is
Arnd/Olof or Linus complaining about there being too many files to
maintain? Do sub-arch maintainers not know which files are theirs?
What problem are we trying to solve here?

If we're talking about moving bindings and dts files out of the
kernel, then call it that. Otherwise, let's not mix the topics. Unless
you want nothing to happen then tie it to moving to a separate
repository.

Not really. A stop-gap would be a couple of kernel cycles in my mind.
PPC dts files have been there forever practically.

That sounds horrible to manage. You are assuming the split between
board and SoC specifics are done perfectly from the start. I haven't
checked the history, but I'm going to guess that has not been the
case. That would effectively make the split be an ABI. Folks have
enough issues with the entire dtb being an ABI.

However, there is a coming issue with Android project Treble which
does say all board specifics are an overlay (or multiple overlays) to
a common SoC base dtb which does make the split an ABI. For mainline
to handle this, we'd need to start making the board files overlays.
And to not break everything, we'd need to apply those overlays at
build time to produce a single board dtb. OTOH, phones aren't really
supported in mainline and vendors will do it wrong before mainline
gets around to it.

That's really a separate problem from where are dts files maintained.

Does u-boot support using the same dtb to configure itself and to pass
to the kernel yet? That was a foreign concept though I think it was
being worked on.

If such a tool existed to add back the annotations. YAML will solve
that, I'm sure.

We could start accepting (but not requiring) patches against the
devicetree-rebasing.git tree if that solves the problem of "kernel
bindings" and "kernel dts files". We can mechanically convert their
paths back to kernel paths and apply them. I've got no issue signing
up to that because I fully expect that to be only a trickle.
